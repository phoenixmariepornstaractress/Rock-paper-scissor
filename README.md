Dear C++ Developers,

We are looking to expand and enhance our existing console-based game, which includes core functionalities such as registration, login, gameplay (Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock), and player achievements. We seek your expertise to add new features, improve the current code, and ensure robustness and scalability. Specifically, we aim to integrate more gameplay modes, enhance the user interface, implement a comprehensive friend system, and refine the achievement tracking. Your contributions will be pivotal in creating a more engaging and immersive experience for our users.
Thank you for your collaboration!
